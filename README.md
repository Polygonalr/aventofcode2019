# Advent of Code 2019 - Rust

Advent of Code done in Rust.

Days 1-5 were done while being quarantined (due to COVID-19), to learn Rust and at the same time practise competitive programming. Day 6 onwards pending.

Code found here strive for efficiency and readability whenever possible. Though, you still may encounter bad rookie practices in the code because I am still really new to Rust while doing these exercises.
