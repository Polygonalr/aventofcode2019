# Avent of Code 2019 - Rust

Avent of Code done in Rust.

These are done while being quarantined (due to COVID-19), to learn Rust and at the same time practise competitive programming. Code found here strive for efficiency and readability whenever possible. Though, you still may encounter bad rookie practices in the code because I am still really new to Rust while doing these exercises.
